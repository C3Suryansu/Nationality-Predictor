# Nationality-Predictor

This a RNN based model for predicting the nationality (or the language the person the person's name is) given the name of the person.
We trained the model based on RNN, LSTM and GRU networks. 
For each we attained different accuracies, with LSTM and GRU being better than normal RNN network. 

The maximum accuracy attained was with 11000 epochs in the GRU network, with an accuracy of 80.47% in top1 classification and top2 accuracy being 88.07%

The hyperparameters can be tuned more to attain even more accuracy.

This project is part of the RNN module of the deep learning certification course of www.guvi.in and the code and dataset was provided in their course itself.
